This is a repository containing all my data structure practical experiments.
It covers some basic data structure concepts like -

stack, 
linear-queue, 
circular-queue,
simple-linked-list, 
doubly-linked-list, 
binary search in an array,
quick-sort algorithm.

All the programs here are in C language.
These were the experiments I had performed in the course 'Data Structures' (Semester 3).
